  "content": "<h2>A bit of Trump Ipsum follows</h2><p>Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes! He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured. Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision.</p><p>I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud.</p><p>Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't. All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, \"I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice.\"</p>"
